##Introduction
The **AmiMat** project is a collaboration by [R1cebank](http://github.com/R1cebank) and [Wyvernzora](https://github.com/jluchiji) to create a lightweight animation framework. The animation framework is mainly intended for developing desktop sprites, but it would also be perfect for other 2D animations, including games.

The AniMat Studio will support multiple project types, including **AniMat Resource Files**, **BarloX Animation** and even **GIF**.

##Project Types
###AmiMat Resource File
AmiMat Resource File is a great way to unify all your image frames and action sequences into one package. The AmiMat is specifically designed for game developers, who need a high level of flexibility and control over the animation. However, if your animation mostly runs on its own, you may consider using BarloX Animation.

###BarloX Animation
BarloX Animation is a plug-and-play type of animation file, with a self-guiding animation system. It can independently decide what animation sequence to play next, and supports both random decisions and decisions based on external events. However, if you need greater control over your animation that simple sequence jumps, please consider using AniMat Resource File.

###GIF File
Good ol' GIF is supported everywhere, so it is your best bet if you wanna use your animation all over the place. You can render you existing project of any type to a GIF image, but please note that interactive features are not supported there.
